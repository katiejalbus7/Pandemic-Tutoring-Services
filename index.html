		<div class="whoarewepara"><p>As the 2020-21 school year approaches, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to force many school districts to designate learning to be completed virtually. Pandemic Tutoring Services is a volunteer organization created to supply additional 1 on 1 and small group services to students for free as they adapt to learning online. This organization was formed by and consists of Michigan State students with a mission to support learning within the Lansing School District for the duration of the coronavirus pandemic. This has been and will continue to be a difficult year; however, when we band together, we can overcome the challenges which arise from this virus.</p></div>
